# catchacab
Repository for hackaTUM 2018

Software for the autonomous detection of potential passengers trying to flag a cab by using hand signals.

We intend to submit our work for two different challenges:

Challenge1: App-free Car Hailing (Autonomous Intelligent Driving)

Challenge description:
"By now it's clear that self-driving cars will soon be available to everyone. Every major player envisions a future where going from one place to another is just a few taps on your phone away. Except for AID. We believe we can make the experience even easier for the user by explicitly NOT making a smartphone app. We remember the times where it was possible to loudly scream "Taxi" to get a ride, where you would simply wave down to a car to join in or where you would simply stand at the sidewalk to have a taxi stop in front of you. And besides, why should people without smartphones be kept off the ride anyway?
During the hackaTUM we want to challenge students to think about alternative ways to draw the attention of an Autonomous Shuttle Service, make it stop next to you and join the ride from your standpoint A to a destination B within the regular journey path without using your smartphone at all. Do you have to wave to make it stop (gesture recognition)? Do you scream the name of the car (audio analysis)? Do people have to show a QR code or other marker in order to get a ride (visual recognition)?"

Challenge2: Smart Vision Application (Intel)

Challenge description: 
"Create your own smart vision application:
- Analyze the building blocks we are providing you
    - Deep-Learning models and code samples to run them (OpenVINO)
    - OpenCV for traditional CV
- Create a realistic scenario for your demo
- Code it
- Present to us the scenario and results"

To build the code, follow the instructions on our wiki page.
